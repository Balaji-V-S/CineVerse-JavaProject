# CineVerse: Core Java Movie Booking System

A **command-line based movie booking and review system** built with **Core Java, JPA, and Hibernate**, designed to showcase a robust **three-layered architecture** without the use of frameworks like Spring.

---

# About The Project
CineVerse serves as a **practical, hands-on guide** to building backend applications from the ground up.  

It focuses on mastering fundamental concepts such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data persistence with **JPA/Hibernate**
- Clean architectural design

By **intentionally avoiding frameworks**, the project highlights the **core mechanics** of:
- Transaction management
- Dependency handling
- Separation of concerns  

This makes it an **ideal learning resource** for developers looking to strengthen their foundational Java skills.

The application simulates a **real-world movie platform**, allowing users to:
- Register and log in
- Book tickets for movies
- Write and view reviews  
with distinct roles for **Customers** and **Administrators**.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based User Management**  
  Clear distinction between **Admin** and **Customer** roles.

- **Full CRUD Functionality**  
  Admins can create, read, update, and delete movies & showtimes.

- **Ticket Booking System**  
  Customers can view movies, book tickets, and manage seat availability.

- **Movie Review & Rating System**  
  Customers can write reviews, rate movies, and see recalculated average ratings.

- **Custom Exception Handling**  
  Business rules enforced through a dedicated exception hierarchy (e.g., `SeatsUnavailableException`, `DuplicateReviewException`).

- **JPA-Based Persistence**  
  All data persisted to a **MySQL database** using **Hibernate ORM**.
